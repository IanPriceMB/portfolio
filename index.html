      <h1>A History of What Makes Me, Well... Me!</h1>
      <p>
        Hey there! My name is, Ian Price. I am an experienced full-stack web developer and front end designer.
         That being said, in today’s world I feel like it’s even more important to get to know who you are hiring 
         and whether they are a good fit with the company's culture, than it is to just look at their skills 
         or experience. So, I implore you, take a few more seconds from your day to hear about my story - strap in!
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘MaddBuddha’ a name that will live in infamy… Well, not really, but it is a name that is very important to me; 
        it’s my gamer tag. You see, before I made my transition into a web developer I was a professional esports athlete 
        and collegiate coach in the Blizzard title, “Heroes of the Storm”. In fact, it was my passion for gameing 
        that got me to where I am in life now. I know, I know, the question is, “How did you go from a professional 
        gamer to a web developer?” Trust me I get it, I am pleasantly surprised that my life has gone like this as well. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, when I was a professional gamer, the money in Heroes of the Storm wasn’t very good. So, I did coaching 
        and a bit of freelance video editing on the side to make ends meet. I worked for a variety of game companies producing 
        content for their social media platforms over the years, and it was this experience that would later give rise to 
        my drive to be a web developer. 
      </p>
      <p>Eventually I would lose my drive to compete in Heroes of the Storm professionally and I needed a new avenue in life. 
        It was then that my experience as an interactive media designer inspired me to broaden my horizons in interactive 
        media and go to school for web development at the University of Denver. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A hard grind later and here I am now, none the worse for wear (and with cool new skills). 
        Do I sound like the kind of guy you want in deep diving your code? Check out some of the 
        projects I’ve worked on by <a href="./Projects.html">clicking here.</a>
