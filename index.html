      <h1>A History of What Makes Me, Well... Me!</h1>
      <p>
        ‘MaddBuddha’ a name that will live in infamy… Well, not really, but it is a name that is very important 
        to me, it’s my gamer tag. You see, before I made my transition into a web developer I was a professional 
        esports athlete and collegiate coach of the Blizzard game, “Heroes of the Storm”. In fact, it was my 
        passion for gaming that got me to where I am now. I know, I know, the question is, “How did you go from a 
        professional gamer to a web developer?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Well you see, when I was a professional gamer, I did individual and team coaching as well as freelance video 
        editing on the side to make ends meet. Over the years, I worked for a variety of game companies producing content 
        and developing the strategies they employed on their social media platforms. The real kicker to me though is that
        I managed to do this in between rounds of binging anime, kpop, and hindi music videos and becoming a treasure trove
        of random pointless triva.   
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few years, I finished my Heroes of the Sorm career and decided that I wanted to further my abilities in 
        multi-media and thus attended the University of Denver for web design. A hard grind later and here I am now, 
        none the worse for wear and with some awesome new skills.
