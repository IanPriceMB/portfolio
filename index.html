          M.E. Price Fine Art is a web gallery for displaying the artwork of master painter and encaustic designer M.E. Price.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am constructing a web gallery that may, in the future, expand into a full shop. It has been a lot of fun to learn new ways to do CRUD operations. 
          I have found a personal love for JavaScript fetch through this project, and learned quite a lot about the inner workings of React.
        <!-- Tech Stack -->
        <p>
          M.E. Price Fine Art has been entirely built in the MERN stack utilizing React, Node, Express, Mongoose, and more.

        <p>
          This project is for the twitch.tv personality The Geeze. I was tasked with taking everything that encompassed  Geeze's online presence and making it all accessible from one place. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Geeze is an exciting and extravagant personality and I worked to capture that in the website. I also was able to incorporate my skills with Adobe Creative Suite by creating custom videos and images for the site.
        <!-- Tech Stack -->
        <p>
          The Geeze Website is built in JavaScript, JQuery, and CSS on the front end with an Express/ Node back end. I used the back end primarily for scraping data from YouTube to display in the videos section.
