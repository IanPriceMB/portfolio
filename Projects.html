            The Nexus Gaming Series is dedicated to providing the professional quality esports tournaments, leagues and content for amateur and semi-professional players in the Blizzard title, 'Heroes of the Storm'.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have contributed code to the Nexus Gaming Series' enterprise scale web project, including the creation of the landing page seen below. As well as to the website for tracking and managing all aspects of the competitive side of their business, including the scheduling and managing of all the teams participating and their statistics.

            Underhaus Games is an indie game publisher whose first ever game demo was showcased on the main E3 showfloor. Committed to creating fun games over quick cash grabs, Underhaus only delivers the kinds of excellent experiences gamers crave.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been working with Underhaus as the team lead for map design as well as a principal games developer, having contributed major fundamental blocks to the code including the game loop and engine work.
          <!-- Tech Stack -->
          <p>
            The Underhaus Games project has been entirely built in Java.

            M.E. Price Fine Art is a web gallery for displaying the artwork of master painter and encaustic designer M.E. Price.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am constructing a web gallery that may, in the future, expand into a full shop. It has been a lot of fun to learn new ways to do CRUD operations. 
            I have found a personal love for JavaScript fetch through this project, and learned quite a lot about the inner workings of React.
          <p>
            M.E. Price Fine Art has been entirely built in the MERN stack utilizing React, Node, Express, Mongoose, and more.
